Amazon said 54 states, provinces, districts and territories in the United States, Canada and
Mexico were represented in the bids.

Some said this month they could offer Amazon billions of dollars in tax breaks if they were
chosen. New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if
Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, for instance.
